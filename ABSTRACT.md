The authors of the **Insulator-Defect Detection** dataset highlight the significant challenge faced by existing detection methods when identifying insulators with minor defects in transmission line images with complex backgrounds.

Insulators play a crucial role as electrical equipment in overhead transmission lines, providing electrical insulation and mechanical fixation. Over time, insulators are prone to various defects, including self-explosion, damage, pollution flashover, and current leakage, due to exposure to strong electric fields and harsh environments.

Among the common faults, insulator damage and surface defects caused by pollution flashovers are prevalent. Pollution flashovers occur when pollutants accumulate on the insulation surface, creating a conductive film that reduces insulation strength and increases leakage current, leading to partial discharge. Insulator defects contribute to more than half of power grid system failures, making rapid detection and identification of insulators and their defects valuable for maintenance and repair personnel.

Traditional insulator-defect detection methods involve helicopter-manned or field inspections, or the use of traditional detection algorithms on images captured by robots or drones. However, the complexity of China's transmission line structure makes these methods inefficient and resource-intensive. Uncrewed aerial vehicles capture images with a large field of view, posing challenges in targeting insulator defects due to the complex background environment and small defect targets, which can hinder defect detection. Thus, there is an urgent need to propose a small-target fault detection method for transmission lines with complex backgrounds to enhance detection efficiency.

In the field of electric power, there are limited published insulator-defect datasets, particularly for overhead transmission lines. The dataset created by the authors consists of 1600 original images collected from sources like Baidu, Google, and public datasets. The images have high-resolution with width and height values ranging from 2000 to 5000 and 2000 to 3000 pixels, respectively. The insulator dataset was constructed based on the original pictures and includes two main defects: *pollution flashover* and *damage*.
