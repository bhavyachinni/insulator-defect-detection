**Insulator-Defect Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1600 images with 5373 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *insulator*, *pollution-flashover*, and *broken*.

Images in the Insulator-Defect Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (1296 images), *test* (160 images), and *val* (144 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the Changzhou University and Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
